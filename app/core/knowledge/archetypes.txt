Archetype
1.​ Hero

Strengths
Relentless in the face of adversity, with a deep-rooted need to protect, prove, and persevere.
Their strength often arises from early experiences of needing to "step up" or "save the day" —
sometimes too early in life. They thrive when given a mission and clarity of purpose.

Conflict Resolution
Prefers direct action, problem-solving, and "fix-it" approaches. Can bypass emotional nuance in
favor of resolution. Conflict feels like a battlefield — they may subconsciously recreate
adversarial dynamics even when collaboration is possible.

Attachment
Often forms earned-secure or anxious-preoccupied attachments. Early caretaking roles or
having to “be strong” for others might make vulnerability feel risky. May seek validation through
being useful or heroic in relationships.

Emotional Expression
Expresses emotion through doing rather than feeling. Anger and frustration may be more
accessible than grief, shame, or helplessness. They may suppress softer emotions out of fear
that they’ll lose their edge.

Volume of Voice
Tends to speak with conviction and urgency. Loudness or firmness may be a learned defense to
command respect or signal certainty — a subconscious strategy to avoid being dismissed or
feeling powerless.

Sense of Control
Strong internal locus of control — feels personally responsible for outcomes, often to the point
of over-functioning. Can struggle with delegating or trusting others to carry out the mission.

Response to Power
Simultaneously reveres and resents power. May seek it to protect others or fix broken systems,
but often distrusts those who wield it carelessly. May unconsciously replicate controlling
behaviors while trying to be the “good” leader.

Leadership Style
Purpose-driven, action-oriented, and dependable. Leads from the front, often taking on too
much. Their leadership shines in crisis but may struggle in ambiguity or emotional nuance
unless growth work has been done.

Response to Uncertainty
Triggers anxiety — uncertainty feels like failure in waiting. The Hero craves control and clarity.
Uncertainty may mirror earlier life experiences where unpredictability meant danger or
abandonment.

Sense of Responsibility
Overdeveloped. Carries burdens not meant for them — often shaped by early enmeshment,
parentification, or witnessing chaos without adequate support. Their “I’ll handle it” mindset
becomes both their superpower and their exhaustion point.

Archetype
2.​ Lover

Strengths
Deeply empathetic, emotionally attuned, relationally intelligent. They intuit the needs of others
and excel in fostering belonging. Their core gift is emotional presence — creating spaces where
people feel seen, valued, and loved.

Conflict Resolution
Tends to avoid direct confrontation to preserve harmony. Uses emotional intelligence to
de-escalate and maintain connection. May over-accommodate or self-abandon to keep peace,
especially if they equate conflict with emotional rupture.

Attachment
Often leans toward anxious-preoccupied or disorganized attachment styles. There may be a
subconscious fear of abandonment or rejection that drives their people-pleasing tendencies.
Connection feels like survival.

Emotional Expression
Highly expressive — feels and emotes deeply. However, they may sometimes use emotional
expression to manage others' feelings (e.g., caretaking, smoothing tension) rather than
expressing raw, unfiltered truth.

Volume of Voice
Often soft, melodic, or emotionally responsive. Volume changes depending on emotional safety
— in safe spaces, they’re expressive and open. In unsafe ones, they may go quiet or perform
connection rather than truly feel it.

Sense of Control
Externalized in relationships — how others feel about them deeply affects their internal state.
They may give away power to maintain bonds, struggling to hold boundaries without guilt or
shame.

Response to Power
Subconsciously wary of power when it's cold or controlling, may associate power with emotional
neglect or rupture. They tend to seek influence through connection, not control, but may
struggle to own their own power fully.

Leadership Style
Heart-led, collaborative, and inclusive. They lead through trust, emotional resonance, and
relationship-building. They often excel in mentorship, culture-building, and team cohesion. But
may struggle with assertiveness and decision-making when it risks relational tension.

Response to Uncertainty
Emotionally unsettling. Uncertainty may feel like a threat to connection or belonging, especially
if they’ve experienced emotional unpredictability or rejection in formative relationships. They
may seek reassurance or over-function in relationships to stabilize.

Sense of Responsibility
Feels responsible for others’ emotional well-being. Can become emotionally enmeshed or
burned out from over-caretaking. Often shaped by early dynamics where their attunement
became a way to earn love or avoid rejection.

Archetype
3.​ Jester

Strengths
Brings joy, lightness, and perspective. Masters the art of reframing heavy situations. Often the
emotional “pressure valve” in groups. Can say difficult truths masked in humor. Keeps morale
high and breaks rigidity.

Conflict Resolution
Uses humor or playfulness to diffuse tension. May avoid direct conflict by deflecting, joking, or
shifting energy. Subconsciously uncomfortable with emotional intensity or confrontation.

Attachment
Often avoidant or disorganized — hides emotional needs behind humor. May feel safest when
not taken too seriously, fearing intimacy or vulnerability will lead to rejection. Connection is
maintained through levity, not depth.

Emotional Expression
Expressive but often in masked forms — laughter, irony, sarcasm. May struggle to express
sadness, fear, or shame openly. Emotions are rerouted into entertainment or distraction.

Animated, dynamic, and variable. Volume is used strategically to entertain or engage. Often
louder in groups; may fall quiet when vulnerability is needed. A defense mechanism to stay “on”

Deflects or distracts. Uncertainty triggers hidden anxiety. Uses humor, play, or chaos to regain a
sense of control. May appear nonchalant while feeling unanchored inside.

Reluctant to be “the responsible one.” Responsibility can feel heavy or joy-killing. May have
internalized shame about not being seen as dependable. Often hides this by over-performing in
lightheartedness or creative value.
