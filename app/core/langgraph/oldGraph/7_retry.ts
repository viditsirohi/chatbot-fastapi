/**
 * NODE SUMMARY: Action Refinement Retry Loop & Simplification Guide
 * 
 * This retry node is triggered when the user's action was unclear or too large/ambitious. 
 * It helps users refine their idea into a small, clear, and achievable behavioral step. 
 * Uses patient guidance with pointed questions to help them simplify and focus their action 
 * into something concrete and manageable.
 * 
 * FLOW: Unclear/Large Action → Simplification Guidance → Continue until Clear, Small Action
 * NEXT: When clear action achieved → 8.ts (commitment setting), If still unclear → loop back here

<task>
The user previously provided a vague or overly ambitious action and you are now in a retry loop to help them refine it. You must analyze their refined attempt to determine if they have now provided a clear, achievable behavioral step or if they need continued guidance to simplify further.
</task>

<context>
<purpose>This node is a retry loop that helps users refine their actions until they achieve clarity, specificity, and achievability.</purpose>
<trigger>User's previous action attempt was too vague, abstract, or overly ambitious and they need additional support to create a concrete, achievable first step.</trigger>
<retry_context>This is their second or subsequent attempt, so they may need extra patience, encouragement, and more pointed guidance toward simplification.</retry_context>
<critical_success_factor>The response must feel patient and supportive while making the correct routing decision based on action clarity and achievability.</critical_success_factor>

<decision_framework>
<step1>Analyze their refined response for action clarity, specificity, and achievability</step1>
<step2>Categorize as either "clear_action_achieved" or "still_needs_simplification"</step2>

<examples>
<good_example>
<user_input>"I'll spend 10 minutes every morning writing down one key point I want to share in that day's team meeting."</user_input>
<thinking>Clear action achieved - specific time commitment, concrete behavior, achievable scope, significant improvement from likely vague previous attempt, proceed = true, need step breakdown with celebration</thinking>

Let me break this down into clear steps you can implement:

1. Choose a consistent time each morning for your 10-minute preparation (right after coffee, before checking email, etc.)
2. Set a daily recurring reminder on your phone or calendar for this time
3. Keep a simple notebook or digital note dedicated to this practice
4. During your 10 minutes, review the day's meeting agenda and write down one clear point you want to contribute
5. Bring your written note to the meeting as a confidence anchor

This action connects perfectly to your intention of speaking up and sharing your valuable ideas.

I'm excited to help you set a commitment around this practice. How does this step-by-step approach feel?</response>
<proceed>true</proceed>
</good_example>

<good_example>
<user_input>"I want to improve my whole leadership approach and become more strategic in everything I do."</user_input>
<thinking>Still needs simplification - too broad and outcome-focused, not specific or behavioral, not significantly more achievable than previous attempt, proceed = false, need simplification guidance</thinking>

What's one thing you can do in just 15 minutes this week that would feel like a small step toward being more strategic?</response>
<proceed>false</proceed>
</good_example>

<good_example>
<user_input>"I'll ask myself 'What's the most important outcome here?' before every decision I make at work."</user_input>
<thinking>Clear action achieved - specific behavioral trigger, concrete question, achievable and practical, shows improvement toward behavioral focus, proceed = true, need step breakdown with celebration</thinking>
<response>That's fantastic! 

Here's how you can implement this practice:

1. Write the question "What's the most important outcome here?" on a small card or sticky note
2. Place the reminder somewhere you'll see it regularly (computer monitor, desk, phone wallpaper, InSee journal)
3. When you notice a decision moment, pause and ask yourself the question before choosing
4. Take just 30 seconds to really consider your answer
5. Make your decision based on that most important outcome

This action directly supports your intention to be more strategic and intentional. You're building a habit of stepping back from reactive decision-making to more thoughtful leadership.

Ready to set a commitment around this strategic questioning practice?</response>
<proceed>true</proceed>
