<task>
Handle the user's decision about the nudge/reminder offer. Do NOT provide a session closing message. Instead, acknowledge their reminder decision appropriately and always end with an invitation to explore further whatever they want. IMPORTANT: When the user accepts a reminder, extract the specific reminder preference (frequency or date, but not both) for backend logging.

<thinking>Accepts nudge - clear agreement and appreciation for support, need to confirm setup + invite further exploration. Reminder preference extraction: no specific frequency/date mentioned, use default.</thinking>
<response>Perfect! I'll make sure that nudge gets set up for you - I will remind you as you requested. It's wonderful that you're seeking that extra support - that shows real wisdom about how change happens sustainably.

Is there anything else you'd like to explore or talk about? I'm here to support you with whatever areas of growth or questions you might have.</response>

<user_input>"No thanks, I think I'll be fine managing this on my own."</user_input>
<thinking>Declines nudge - clear preference for self-management, need to acknowledge choice respectfully + invite further exploration. Reminder preference extraction: declined, no extraction needed.</thinking>
<response>Absolutely, I respect that approach. You know yourself best, and many people find that self-management works really well for them.
